# The Beginning

Hi! My name is T-Way. This is my personal blog where I will share my learning experience, projects, and thoughts on technology.

## Why IT?

I have always been attracted to the opportunity to create something from nothing. Code is a tool that turns ideas into reality.

## About this blog

This blog is written in **Next.js** using **MDX**. This means I can embed interactive components directly into the text.

Stay tuned for updates!
