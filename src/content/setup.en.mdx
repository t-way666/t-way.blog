# Evolution of my Workflow

For a long time, I was a Linux enthusiast. I tried **Arch**, **CachyOS**, **Pop!_OS**. I spent hours configuring **Hyprland** and **Quickshell**, polishing every pixel of the interface. It was cool, I felt like a real hacker.

## Why Windows + WSL2?

At some point, I realized I was spending more time *configuring* the system than *working*. The final straw was the endless struggle with configuring my discrete **NVIDIA** GPU. Anyone who has tried to run Wayland on Nvidia knows the pain.

> Linux is free if your time is free.

Windows 11 with **WSL2** (Ubuntu) gives me the best of both worlds:
1. **Windows:** Stable GUI, trouble-free GPU drivers, Photoshop/DaVinci Resolve for hobbies.
2. **WSL2:** Full-fledged Linux terminal for development (Node.js, Docker, Git).

## My Tool Stack

- **Editor:** VS Code.
- **Terminal:** Windows Terminal + Bash.
- **Notes:** Obsidian (synced via Git).
- **Browsers:** Chrome, Firefox, Zen, Comet (Perplexity).

Now I just work, and it feels great.
